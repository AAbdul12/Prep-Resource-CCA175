PURPOSE
-------
The export tool exports a set of files from HDFS back to an RDBMS. The target table must already exist in the database. The input files are read and parsed into a set of records according to the user-specified delimiters.
The default operation is to transform these into a set of INSERT statements that inject the records into the database. In "update mode," Sqoop will generate UPDATE statements that replace existing records in the database, and in "call mode" Sqoop will make a stored procedure call for each record.

sqoop export (generic-args) (export-args)
