Exports may fail for a number of reasons:

Loss of connectivity from the Hadoop cluster to the database (either due to hardware fault, or server software crashes)
Attempting to INSERT a row which violates a consistency constraint (for example, inserting a duplicate primary key value)
Attempting to parse an incomplete or malformed record from the HDFS source data
Attempting to parse records using incorrect delimiters
Capacity issues (such as insufficient RAM or disk space)
If an export map task fails due to these or other reasons, it will cause the export job to fail. The results of a failed export are undefined. Each export map task operates in a separate transaction. Furthermore, individual map tasks commit their current transaction periodically. If a task fails, the current transaction will be rolled back. Any previously-committed transactions will remain durable in the database, leading to a partially-complete export.
