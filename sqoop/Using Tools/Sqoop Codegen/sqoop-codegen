PURPOSE
-------
The codegen tool generates Java classes which encapsulate and interpret imported records. 
The Java definition of a record is instantiated as part of the import process, but can also be performed separately. 
For example, if Java source is lost, it can be recreated. 
New versions of a class can be created which use different delimiters between fields, and so on.
