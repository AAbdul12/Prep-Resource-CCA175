PURPOSE
-------
The create-hive-table tool populates a Hive metastore with a definition for a table based on a database table previously imported to HDFS,
or one planned to be imported. 
This effectively performs the "--hive-import" step of sqoop-import without running the preceeding import.

If data was already loaded to HDFS, you can use this tool to finish the pipeline of importing the data to Hive. 
You can also create Hive tables with this tool; 
data then can be imported and populated into the target after a preprocessing step run by the user.

SYNTAX
------
sqoop create-hive-table (generic-args) (create-hive-table-args)
sqoop-create-hive-table (generic-args) (create-hive-table-args)
