PURPOSE
-------
The merge tool allows you to combine two datasets where entries in one dataset should overwrite entries of an older dataset. 
For example, an incremental import run in last-modified mode will generate multiple datasets in HDFS where successively newer data appears in each dataset. 
The merge tool will "flatten" two datasets into one, taking the newest available records for each primary key.
