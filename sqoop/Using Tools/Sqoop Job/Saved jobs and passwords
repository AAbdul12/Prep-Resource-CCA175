The Sqoop metastore is not a secure resource. Multiple users can access its contents. For this reason, Sqoop does not store passwords in the metastore. If you create a job that requires a password, you will be prompted for that password each time you execute the job.

You can enable passwords in the metastore by setting sqoop.metastore.client.record.password to true in the configuration.

Note that you have to set sqoop.metastore.client.record.password to true if you are executing saved jobs via Oozie because Sqoop cannot prompt the user to enter passwords while being executed as Oozie tasks.
