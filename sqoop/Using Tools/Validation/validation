PURPOSE
-------
Validate the data copied, either import or export by comparing the row counts from the source and the target post copy.

INTRODUCTION
------------
There are 3 basic interfaces: ValidationThreshold - Determines if the error margin between the source and target are acceptable: Absolute, Percentage Tolerant, etc. Default implementation is AbsoluteValidationThreshold which ensures the row counts from source and targets are the same.

ValidationFailureHandler - Responsible for handling failures: log an error/warning, abort, etc. Default implementation is LogOnFailureHandler that logs a warning message to the configured logger.

Validator - Drives the validation logic by delegating the decision to ValidationThreshold and delegating failure handling to ValidationFailureHandler. The default implementation is RowCountValidator which validates the row counts from source and the target.

SYNTAX
------
sqoop import (generic-args) (import-args)
sqoop export (generic-args) (export-args)

CONFIGURATION
-------------
The validation framework is extensible and pluggable. It comes with default implementations but the interfaces can be extended to allow custom implementations by passing them as part of the command line arguments as described below.

Validator. 

Property:         validator
Description:      Driver for validation,
                  must implement org.apache.sqoop.validation.Validator
Supported values: The value has to be a fully qualified class name.
Default value:    org.apache.sqoop.validation.RowCountValidator
Validation Threshold. 

Property:         validation-threshold
Description:      Drives the decision based on the validation meeting the
                  threshold or not. Must implement
                  org.apache.sqoop.validation.ValidationThreshold
Supported values: The value has to be a fully qualified class name.
Default value:    org.apache.sqoop.validation.AbsoluteValidationThreshold
Validation Failure Handler. 

Property:         validation-failurehandler
Description:      Responsible for handling failures, must implement
                  org.apache.sqoop.validation.ValidationFailureHandler
Supported values: The value has to be a fully qualified class name.
Default value:    org.apache.sqoop.validation.AbortOnFailureHandler

LIMITATIONS
-----------
Validation currently only validates data copied from a single table into HDFS. The following are the limitations in the current implementation:

all-tables option
free-form query option
Data imported into Hive, HBase or Accumulo
table import with --where argument
incremental imports
