   Description	Command
--------------
Autocomplete                                          hive> Press Tab key
                                                      Display all 436 possibilities? (y or n)
                                                      If you enter y, you’ll get a long list of all the keywords
                                                      
Navigation Keystrokes                                 Use the up↑ and down↓ arrow keys to scroll through previous commands
                                                      Ctrl+A goes to the beginning of the line
                                                      Ctrl+E goes to the end of the line
                                                      Delete key will delete the character to the left of the cursor
                                                      
Command History                                       Hive saves the last 100,00 lines into a file $HOME/.hivehistory

Shell Execution                                       type ! followed by the command and terminate the line with a semicolon (;)
                                                      hive> ! /bin/echo "Hello World";
                                                      "Hello World"
                                                      hive> ! pwd;
                                                      /home/me/hiveplay
                                                      (Note: Don’t invoke interactive commands that require user input. Shell “pipes” don’t work and neither do file “globs.”
                                                      For example, ! ls *.hql; will look for a file named *.hql;, rather than all files that end with the .hql extension.)
                                                      
To Print Current DB in use                            set hive.cli.print.current.db=true; (or)
                                                      set hiveconf:hive.cli.print.current.db=true;
                                                      
To remove current db name display in hive shell       set hiveconf:hive.cli.print.current.db=false;

Specifying Metastore location for each user           set hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=/user/myname/hive/warehouse;

System Namespace (provides read-write access 
to Java system properties)                            set system:user.name; (or)
                                                      set system:user.name=yourusername;
                                                      
env Namespace (provides read-only 
access to environment variables)                      set env:HOME;

Hadoop dfs commands inside Hive shell                 Exclude hadoop keyword and end the command with semicolon(;) as below:
                                                      hive> dfs -ls / ; 
                                                      (Note: This method of accessing hadoop commands is actually more efficient than using the hadoop dfs … equivalent at the bash shell, because the latter starts up a new JVM instance each time, whereas Hive just runs the same code in its current process.)
                                                      
Execute hive queries from a file                      source /unix-path/to/file/withqueries.hql;

Print Column Headers                                  SET hive.cli.print.header=true;

Get columns names of the table                        SHOW COLUMNS FROM mytable;

Load data from a local file to the hive table         LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/unix-path/myfile' INTO TABLE mytable;

Load data from hdfs file to the hive table            LOAD DATA INPATH '/hdfs-path/myfile' INTO TABLE mytable;
