STORED BY                           Stored by a non-native table format.

STORED AS TEXTFILE                  Stored as plain text files. 
                                    TEXTFILE is the default file format, unless the configuration parameter hive.default.fileformat has a 
                                    different setting.Use the DELIMITED clause to read delimited files.
                                    Enable escaping for the delimiter characters by using the 'ESCAPED BY' clause (such as ESCAPED BY '\')
                                    Escaping is needed if you want to work with data that can contain these delimiter characters.
                                    A custom NULL format can also be specified using the 'NULL DEFINED AS' clause (default is '\N').
                                    
STORED AS SEQUENCEFILE              Stored as compressed Sequence File.

STORED AS RCFILE                    Stored as Record Columnar File format.

STORED AS PARQUET                   Stored as Parquet format for the Parquet columnar storage format in Hive 0.13.0 and later;
                                    Use ROW FORMAT SERDE ... STORED AS INPUTFORMAT ... OUTPUTFORMAT syntax ... in Hive 0.10, 0.11, or 0.12.
                                    
STORED AS ORC                       Stored as ORC file format. Supports ACID Transactions & Cost-based Optimizer (CBO). Stores column-level metadata.

INPUTFORMAT and OUTPUTFORMAT        in the file_format to specify the name of a corresponding InputFormat and OutputFormat class as a string literal.
                                    For example, 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.contrib.fileformat.base64.Base64TextInputFormat'.

                                    For LZO compression, the values to use are
                                    'INPUTFORMAT "com.hadoop.mapred.DeprecatedLzoTextInputFormat"
                                    OUTPUTFORMAT "org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat"'

                                    (see LZO Compression).
